## Versions
to get a better idea on my idea of versions here is a list of every function/thing the engine should have and what version it should be implemented in

| version | item |
| ------- | ---- |
| v1.0 ✔ | Set up a basic rendering pipeline | 
| v1.0 ✔ | Implement perspective projection to give depth | 
| v1.0 ✔ | Render wireframe triangles 
| v1.0 ✔ | Implement backface culling |
| v1.0 ✔ | Set up basic camera movement (position and simple translation) |
| v1.0 ✔ | Implement transformations (scaling, rotation, translation of objects)|
| v1.1 ✔ | Set up basic camera rotation (e.g., using angles or quaternions) 
| v1.2 ❌ | Add clipping for triangles that are partially off-screen |
| v1.2 ❌ | Implement simple depth buffering (to handle overlapping objects) 
| v2.0 ❌ | Add triangle filling (solid triangles instead of wireframe) |
| v2.1 ❌ | Add basic lighting (ambient and diffuse lighting) |
| v2.1 ❌ | Implement simple shading (flat shading) |
| any ❌ | Optimize backface culling and other basic operations |
